# simonhlee.com

Personal website built with Next.js (App Router), MDX, and Tailwind CSS v4.

Started from the [nim template by ibelick](https://github.com/ibelick/nim).

## Quick start

Requirements
- Node 24.1 (see `.nvmrc`)
- pnpm 10.14.0 (managed via corepack)

Setup
```bash
# set tool versions
corepack enable && corepack use pnpm@10.14.0 && nvm use 24.1

# install and run
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Scripts
- `pnpm dev` — start Next.js (Turbopack)
- `pnpm build` — production build
- `pnpm start` — start production server
- `pnpm lint` — Next.js lint + MDX lint
- `pnpm typecheck` — TypeScript type-check (no emit)
- `pnpm format` — Prettier write

## Content authoring (MDX)
- Blog posts live at `app/blog/<slug>/page.mdx`.
- Recommended frontmatter or exported metadata (at least):
  ```mdx
  ---
  title: "My Post Title"
  description: "Short summary for lists and social previews"
  ---
  ```
- Custom MDX components are mapped in `mdx-components.tsx` (e.g., `Cover`, code highlighting via `sugar-high`).
- The blog list is generated by `lib/server/blog.ts` and surfaced via `/api/blogposts`.

## Styling
- Tailwind CSS v4 using `@tailwindcss/postcss` (see `postcss.config.mjs`).
- Global theme and utilities in `app/globals.css` and `lib/styles/theme.css`.

## Deploy
- Designed for Vercel (Next.js 15). Typical flow:
  - Push to default branch to trigger deploy
  - Environment URLs are auto-provisioned per PR

## Notes
- Contact: an inline form is included on the homepage; a simple API handler will be added in a follow-up.
- Roadmap and work notes live under `.warp/` (ignored by git):
  - `.warp/ROADMAP.md` — phases and acceptance criteria
  - `.warp/ProjectAreas.md` — hireability focus areas
  - `.warp/WARP.md` — runbook (commands, architecture)
