# simonhlee.com

Personal website built with Next.js (App Router), MDX, and Tailwind CSS v4.

Started from the [nim template by ibelick](https://github.com/ibelick/nim).

## Quick start

Requirements

* Node 24.1 (see `.nvmrc`)
* pnpm 10.16.x

Setup

```bash
# set tool versions
corepack enable && corepack use pnpm@10.16.0 && nvm use 24.1

# install and run
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Scripts

* `pnpm dev` — start Next.js (Turbopack)
* `pnpm build` — production build
* `pnpm start` — start production server
* `pnpm lint` — Next.js lint + MDX lint
* `pnpm typecheck` — TypeScript type-check (no emit)
* `pnpm format` — Prettier write

## Content authoring (MDX)

* Blog posts live at `app/blog/<slug>/page.mdx`.
* Recommended frontmatter or exported metadata (at least):
  ```mdx
  ---
  title: "My Post Title"
  description: "Short summary for lists and social previews"
  ---
  ```
* Custom MDX components are mapped in `mdx-components.tsx` (e.g., `Cover`, code highlighting via `sugar-high`).
* The blog list is generated by `lib/server/blog.ts` and surfaced via `/api/blogposts`.

## Styling

* Tailwind CSS v4 using `@tailwindcss/postcss` (see `postcss.config.mjs`).
* Global theme and utilities in `app/globals.css` and `lib/styles/theme.css`.

## Deploy

* Designed for Vercel (Next.js 16). Typical flow:
  * Push to default branch to trigger deploy
  * Environment URLs are auto-provisioned per PR

## Notes

* Contact: an inline form is included on the homepage; a simple API handler will be added in a follow-up.
* Roadmap and work notes live under `.warp/` (ignored by git):
  * `.warp/ROADMAP.md` — phases and acceptance criteria
  * `.warp/ProjectAreas.md` — hireability focus areas
  * `WARP.md` — runbook (commands, architecture)
