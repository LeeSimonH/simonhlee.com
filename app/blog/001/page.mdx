Hi there! I'm Simon, the | I'm a co-creater of [svve11](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/Svve11) — _an open-source library of [Svelte](http://svelte.dev/) components focused on web accessibility._

In my spare time, I like to [climb](https://www.instagram.com/crimpwimp/), [draw](https://www.instagram.com/nomis_heel/), [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50267865-simon-lee), noodle on the guitar, and [snap photos](https://vsco.co/simonhl/gallery). 

In a past life, I worked as a designer at [Walker Macy](https://www.walkermacy.com/) — _an award-winning landscape architecture and planning firm based in the Pacific Northwest._
